A DAYSO WELL YESTERDAY AT CHRIS ROUND OUR CHRISTMAS TIME WE GATHERED AND WE READ THE CHRISTMAS STORY FIRST FROM MATTHEW AND THEN WE READ IT FROM LUKE THAT'S WHERE THE THE NVITY STORIES THAREFROM AND THERE IS A WORD THAT IS OFTEN TRANSLATED THAT WE TRANSLATE IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT IS THE WORD WISE MEN WHICH ACTUALLY COMES FROM THE ORIGINAL WORD WHICH IS MAGI WHICH MEAN S A PERSIAN PRIEST RIGHT SO THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMEBODY FROM PERSIA WHICH IS EAST AND THAT MGS THEY'VE TRAVELLED A LONG WAY TO BE THERE TO SEE THE SUN TO SEE THE CHILD TO BE BORN AND THEY BRING THREE GIFTS AND ALL OF US KNOW THESE GIFTS AND ONE IS GOLD RIGHT NOW SISSY YOU BRING A KING GOLD RIGHT YOU BRING A KINGOLD THAT MAKES SENSE THAT'S PRETTY EASY STRAIGHTFORWARD SECONDLY IS FRANKINSENSE NOW FRANK INSENSE IS SOMETHING TOLY DIFFERENT WHAT HAPPENS IS IS FREGANT SENSE IS WHAT YOU USE TO ANOINT THE NEW KING AND THENEN NOW MONTETHIS THIS NEXT ONE'S A LITTLE WEIRD RIGH THE NEXT ONE IS MUR AND YOU USE THAT TO ANOINT A DEAD BODY SO WHEN THE WISE MEN SHOWED UP WERE THE MADGE I SHOWED UP THEY SHOWED UP WITH PRESENTS ONE BECAUSE THEY'R THE KING TWO TO ANOINT THE NEW KING AND ANOTHER GIFT TO ANOINT THE KING WHO HAD JUST PASSED AWAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE A KING WITHOUT ANOTHER KING PASS A NEW KING WITHOUT ANOTHER KING PASSING AWAY NOW HERE'S THE THING MANY OF YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THIS OR NOT BUT YESTERDAY AT WENSHER CASTLE AH THERE WAS A BREAK IN WHILE THE QUEEN WAS THERE WITH HER FAMILY AND THE THING IS THE GUY DIDN'T GET VERY FAR BUT HOW IVE YOU KNOW IS THAT THAT COULD HAVE GONE REALLY POORLY AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD A NEW KING IN ENGLAND AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT THAT'S WHAT THE MADGE S WERE THERE BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE THREE THINGS WE SEE THAT THOSE GIFTS REPRESENT EXACTLY WHO JESUS SAYS HE IS OUR KING HE IS THE KING OF KINGS AND THE LORD OF LORDS AND UPON HIS HIP WILL BE WRITTEN KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS AND HE WILL BE WRITING UPON A STALLION AND HE WILL BECOMING TO RESTORE THE WORLD TO WHAT IT SHOULD BE THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT HE IS OUR LIVING KING HE IS THE NEW KING HE IS THE KING WHO IS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER MAKING INTERCESSION FOR US BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT HE IS THE KING THAT UPON HIS BIRTH WITH SENTENCED TO DIE SO THAT YOU AND I COULD RECEIVE NEW LIFE AND SO TO DAY I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BID ABOUT SOME DIFFERENT PRESENTS SO A LITTLE GIRL A WICH WAS AT GETTING READY FOR EASTERNEMIES WORE A GET TO SGIM READY FOR CHRISTMAS TIME AND AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT STUFF AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BABY AND WHY JESUS WAS SUCH A GIFT AND IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS A GIFT OF LOVE IN THE LITTLE GIRL THOUGHT LIKE THAT IDEA AND SO FOR CHRISTMAS THEY THEY A THAT THE LITTLE GIRL HAD WRAPPED HER OWN PRESENCS SHE HAD STUCK THEM UNDER THE TREE FOR ALL THE MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY AND SO WHEN EVERYBODY OPENED THEM THEY WERE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WOULD BE IN IT BECAUSE THE LITTLE GIRL DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY ACH GEN RALLY HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT THE THE PARENTS OPENED THE FIRST BOX AND IT WAS EMPTY AND THEN THE FATHER OPENED THE SECOND BOX AND IT WAS EMPTY AND THEN THE SIBLINGS OPENED THEIR BOXES AND THEY WERE LIKE AND THEY WERE LIE A A WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THESE BOXES SHE SAID I PUT SOME KISSES IN THOSE BOXES FOR YOU GUIS HE GOES LIKE THAT STORY THAT'S A GOOD MAN YOU TILLYY YOULL TELL THAT STORY TO MORROWINT SEE WHEN WE STARE TALKIN ABOUT CHRISTMAS WE SAR TALKIN ABOUT WHAT WE'D Y DO AS UN LUFF CHRISCAME TO THIS EARTH AS A SIGN OF LOVE FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US NOW NOW SOME PEOPLE OVER CHRISTMAS WE GET SIDETRACED A LOT RIGHT AH MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT MANY YOU KNOW THAT THAT ONE OF THE PROBEMS THAT ALWAYS HAVE WITH WITH WHEN I TO SAY IT CHRISTMAS BUT ONE OF THE PROMS ALWAYS HAVE IT CHRISTMAS IS AT SOMETIMES WE EVEN AS BELIEVERS GET SIDE TRAACT FROM WHAT GOD ANTS AN IN IN HIS DOING IN THIS SEASON SEE WE DON'T COME AS A POINT TO GOD TO SAY SAY THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US AND IT'S GREAT FOR US THE FOCUS ON WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN US BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE REALIZE THE TGOD OF THE UNIVERSE LEFT HAVE HIM AND DWELT AMONG US FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW LEAS AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY AND LEASTUS SAID WHEN JESUS WAS BORN AS A BABY HOW MUCH DID HE KNOW NOW I WOIN TO TELL YOU SOMETHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES IHALF A COUPLE OF KIDS AND I HAVE OFTEN SAID I AM SO GLAD I AM NOT A TEA NAGER ANY MORE I AM SO GLAD I AM NOT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ANYMORE BUT COULD YOU IMAGINE BEING THE LORD OF THE UNIVERSE AND BEING HAVING TO WEAR DIPERS HE BUNT I MEAN THE THING IS IS THAT THE LORD OF THE UNIVERSE BECAME FLESH AND DWELT AMONGST US AN HE HE DID IT ONCE AND NOW AS HE LEFT HE SAID CONTINUED TO LOOK FOR ME TO DO IT AGAIN LUKE ONE  THIRTY FIVE SAYS THIS THE ANGELS ANSWERED AND SAID TO HER THE HOLY SPURE IT WILL COME UPON YOU AND THE POWER OF THE MOST HIGH WILL OVERSHADOW YOU AND FOR THAT REASON THE HOLY CHILD SHALL BE CALLED THE SON OF GOD THE GREATEST GIFT WE EVER GOT WAS THE HOLY CHILD THE SON OF GOT UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT THE STORY IS WE NEVER ASKED FOR IT WE NEVER ASKS FOR IT SEE IN THE THING IS IS THAT IS THAT IN ORDER TO NEED THE SAVIOUR TO COME THAT MINTS THAT WE NEEDED SAVING THAT MEANT THAT WE NEEDED IT BECAUSE WE AND OURSELVES WERE NOT PERFECT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND INTERESTING ALL THE TIME IS IS THAT WHEN SOMETIMES I HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT JESUS LIKE LIKE HE'S JEST MY BUDDY NOW WHEN I WAS A KID WE ALL HAD A THERE WAS A TOY O DONT NIF YOU GOT TO REMOR THIS AND IT WAS CALLED MY BUDDY AND MY BROTHER HAD O MY BUDDY BECAUSE HE'S TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME AND IT WAS COOL AN I WAS FINE FOR SIX YEAR OLD TO HAVE I MY BUDY IT WAS A DOLL THAT SET A BIT LIKE THIS AN IT HAD OVER ALLS ON AN MY BUTY WAS JUST A BABY WHOS A BABY DOLL AN SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS EVERY ONE WANTED O MY BUDY FOR CHRISTMAS AND SO MY MAM AND DAD WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ONE NICE GIFT FOR MY BROTHER AND IT WAS A MY BUDDY DOLL AND MY BROTHER PLAYED WITH IT FOR AN ENTIRE DAY AND THEN HE PUT IT WITH THE REST OF OR TOIS AND THEN WHEN MY BROTHER'S FRIENDS WOULD COME OVER THEY WOULD GO HE WOULD GO LOOK I HAVEN'T MY BUDY  LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES AND EVERYONE SAY WHYLE THAT'S GREAT AND THEN HE WOULDN'T REALLY PLAY WITH IT A WHOLE LOT AND THEN WOULD PEOPLE WOULD SHOW UP OR WHEN MAMMA WOULD ASK HIM HE WOULD KNOW HE WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT MYBODY WAS BUT HE NEVER PLAYED WITH IT SEE SOMETIMES IN OUR LIFE WE HAVE BEEN GIVIN A GIFT AN WE TREATED THE GIFT LIKE HE'S JUST OF MY BUDDY LIKE HE'S JUST SITTIN OVER THERE IN THE CORNER LIKE HEY LOOK THERE'S MY BUDDY JESUS HE'S JUST SITTING RIGHT OVER THERE NWE HAVE COMPLETELY ABANDONED THE REALIZATION THAT HE'S MORE THAN JUST THIS THING THAT WE OWN WHERE HE'S MORE THAN JUST THIS THING THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN HE'S MORE THAN JUST THE GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE HE IS THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD AND IF WE WOULD ALLOW OURSELVES TO HAVE FAITH IN THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD AND TO APPRECIATE HIM FOR ALL THAT HE IS LISA WAS WATCHING A SHOW THE OTHER DAY I'M NOT REALLY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SHURE WHAT SHOW IT WAS BUT IT HAD TO DO WITH A ENGLAND AN THE AFTER CALL AN THE MIDWIPS ES NOW WAS YELLIN MAT ME AND IT HAS IT HAS TO DO WITH POSTWORLD WAR TOO AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE OUTSIDE DIGGING UP THE GROUND THEY'RE GOING TO FIX SOME STUFF AND SO ALL OF USN'T THEY'RE DIGGING EVERYTHING UP AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONSTRUCTION SIGHTT THEY FIND A BOMB THAT HAD NOT BEEN EXPLODED NOW I' WOING TO TAY YO SOMETHING I MUNT TAKE ONE THE THINGS THAT I FIND INTERESTING IS THEY JUST WENT OUT AND STARTED DIGGING THEY JUST WENT OUT AND STARTED TO HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES SOME OF US WEAT WEAT WE GO OUT AND WE THINK WE'RE JUST DOIN SOMETHING THAT'S SIMPLE AND EASY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYTHING TOUGT SHOWS UP AN WE NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP US DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT THINGS AN THE PROBLEM IS IF WE SHOULD HAE HAD JESUS WITH US THE WHOLE TIME SEE WE DON'T NEED EESE US JUST IN THE DIFFICULT TIMES WE NEED JEESE US EVEN IN THE TIMES WHEN WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN HANDLE IT EVEN IN THOSE MOMENTS THAT WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING I MOINT TELL YOU WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT EVEN IN THOSE MOMENTS WE NEED JESUS BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW WHAT IS AROUND THE CORNER WE DON'T KNOW WHAT GIFTS THERE ARE AROUND US WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT WE NE JESUS TO TAKE CARE OF GALLATION SIX AND FOURTEEN SAYS BUT MAY IT NEVER BE THAT I WOULD BOAST  EXCEPT IN THE CROSS OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THROUGH WHICH THE WORLD HAS BEEN HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED TO ME AN I TO THE WORLD WHAT HE'S SAYIN HEAR IS IS IS WE DON'T JUST NEED JESUS WHEN IT'S HEN WE THINK WE NEED HIM WE NEED HIM ALL THE TIME ALL THE TIME THE BOOK OF ROMANS GOES AS FAR AS TO SAY OFFER YOURSELF AS A LIVING SACRIFICE NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU GUISE ONE OF THE TOUGHEST THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT I FIND IS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE IN MOMENTS BUT NOT FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AM E WELL PASTER WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND INTERESTING IS IN THE STATE OF FLORA YOU DON'T NEED CORINSURANCE YOU KNOW THAT SYSTER MAR DID YOU SISTER MAR JUST HER MIND S GOT BELOW YOU DON'T EED CARINSURANCE IN STATE OF MERLIC YOU HAVE TO HAVE CARINSURANCE IN ORDER FOR THAT THING TO RUN RIHT INUMTER BUT WE NEED CARNSUNS I HAD FRIENDS WHO LIVED IN FLORIDA WHO DID NOT HAVE COUNTERED CONRNSARS NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU IS I'M A PRETTY DECENT DRIVER EXCEPT I LIKE TO DRIVE FAST DOWN THIS ROAD AND IT'S WHAT I CALL THE GABRIEL GO TO COLLEGE FUN THAT LITTLE BOT THAT LITTLE SILVER BOX FLASHES AT ME ALL THE TIME SO I HAD FRIENDS WHO WOULDN'T PAY CARNTERS THEY DIDN'T NEED IT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE IT SO THEY D AND GET IT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN BRO THE TRAY I KNOW BUT LIKE IN A MOMENT IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THEY WOULD GET HIT OR THEY WOULD HIT SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN AND THEN THEY WOULD GO OH WOE AS ME AND I'M LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD CORN SHURNS TO START WIITH HISI I THIS IS NOT PART OF THE SERMON BUT GET E TO MAXES YOUR CARNCRNT SKIP AS EXTRA SEE  SOME OF YOU SAY WILL PASS TO WATD HE TALKIN SEE IT'S NOT YOU DON'T HAVE CORINSURANCE PAIN IN ALL THE TIME DURING THE GOOD TIMES AND SAY OH YOU KNOW LIKE THIS IS ONLY FOR THE BAD TI DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT'S GOING ON SEE THE THING ABOUT IT IS AS WEAS BELIEVERS THE REASONN WE ERE TO READ OUR SCRIPTURES AND WE'RE TO PRAY ALL THE TIME IS NOT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE IT FOR EMERGENCIES I MUST HAY THIS WHEN THE THINGS THAT I'VE FOUND INTERESTINGOVER MY LIFE IS THAT THE MORE I GET INTO GOD'S WORD THE MORE I DON'T NEED HIM IN THE MOMENTS OF EMERGENCIES NOW SOME OF YOU SAY PASTOR THAT'S CRAZY LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING IF YOU LEARN TO WALK WITH GOD EVERY SINGLE DAY IT DOESN'T MATTER OFYOU'RE IN THE GOOD TIMES OR IN THE BAD TIMES IF YOU'RE ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP OR YOU'RE IN THE VALLEY OR YOU'RE SOME PLACE IN BETWEEN IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS EXPECT GOD TO BE WITH YOU AN YOU'RE ALWAYS WITH GOD SO WHAT HAPPENS IS AS IF IT'S INTO BAD TIMES I'M WITH GOD I IT'S IN THE GOOD TIMES I'M WITH GOD IF IT'S WHEN EVERYTHING IS BURNIN DOWN OH I'M THANKFUL FOR GOT OR WHEN EVERYTHING IS BEEN BUILT UP I'M WITH GOD IT DOESANT CHANGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD NOT CHANGE OUR FAITH NOW I LOOK OVER HERE UNDERNEATH THE CROSS LITTLE MARY JOSEPH BIBLE SAYS THAT JOSEPH ACTUALLY LOVES MARY AN EVEN WHEN SHE BECAME PREGNANT NOT HIS CHILD HE STILL LOVED HER AN WAS GOING TO DO SOME THING TO TAKE CARE OF HER AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT ONCE HE DECIDED THAT HE WAS GOING TO QUIETLY DIVORCE HER AND PUT HER AWAY SO SHE WOULDN'T BE EMBARRASSE ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ANGEL SHOWED UP TO TALK TO HIM BECAUSE MERCY GIVES BIRTH TO MERCY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND INTERESTING IS THAT THE MORE I LIVE IN THE MERCY OF GOD THE MORE MERCY OF GOD I RECEIVE AT'S OM GOOD TREAT EN THANK YOU SISSY SEE THE THING ABOUT IT IS JOSEPH DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOW HER MERCY HE COULD HAVE JUST THROWN ROUND THE STREET DID ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THEY WOULD HAVE STONED HER TO DEATH BUT INSTEAAD SHOW SUFF SHOWED MERCY I WULL TAY SOMETHING IS THAT WHEN WE DECIDE TO SHOW MORE MERCY THAN ALL OF US UN WE WILL HAVE MORE MERCY IN OUR LIFE MOTHER TERESA RHOTE SAID IT LIKE THIS IT IS CHRISTMAS EVERY TIME YOU LET GODS LOVE LET GOD LOVE OTHERS THROUGH YOU YES IT'S CHRISTMUS EVERY TIME YOU SMILE AT YOUR BROTHER AND OFFER HIM YOUR HELP THE QUESTION IS IS ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW THE MERCY GIVEN TO US TO DAY JUST TO BE A TODAY
